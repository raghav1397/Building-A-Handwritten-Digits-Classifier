# Building A Handwritten Digits Classifier


    explore why image classification is a hard task
    observe the limitations of traditional machine learning models for image classification
    train, test, and improve a few different deep neural networks for image classification

As we mentioned in the first mission in this course, deep neural networks have been used to reach state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks in the last decade. For some image classification tasks, deep neural networks actually perform as well as or slightly better than the human benchmark. You can read about the history of deep neural networks here.
